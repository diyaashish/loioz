This is the naive approahch to the issue. wherein i added radio buttons for status and checkboxes for attributes. after the meeting that took place on 28/06/2023 the approach has changed directions. 
Thus changes made previously are saved here instead of the diyaashish-branch. 

**status of invitees:**
